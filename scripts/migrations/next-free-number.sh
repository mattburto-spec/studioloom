# Migration Number Reserver — LEGACY HELPER
#
# ⚠️  DEPRECATED for new migrations as of 26 Apr 2026.
#     New migrations should use timestamp prefixes (Supabase CLI default):
#         bash scripts/migrations/new-migration.sh <descriptor>
#     Two parallel sessions cannot pick the same UTC second, which kills
#     the collision class entirely. We had two collisions in 24 hours
#     during the Preflight Phase 8 / Lesson Bold overlap before switching.
#
#     This script is kept working for emergency use, branch audits, and
#     reading legacy migration history. Don't author new 3-digit
#     migrations with it unless you have a specific reason and have
#     coordinated with every active worktree.
#
# Finds the next safe migration number across ALL active branches on
# origin, not just your current worktree. Prevents the collision
# story from Phase 8-1 (see docs/projects/preflight-phase-8-1-brief.md).
#
# Why local `ls supabase/migrations/` lies:
#   - Other feature branches may have claimed numbers your branch
#     doesn't see yet (they haven't merged to main).
#   - main may have advanced via parallel branches since last fetch.
#   - You may have pulled main but not noticed which migrations came
#     in.
#
# This script consults origin, asserts the truth across every remote
# branch, and prints both:
#   1. A summary table — which branch's highest migration is what
#   2. The next safe number to use
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/migrations/next-free-number.sh
#   bash scripts/migrations/next-free-number.sh --no-fetch
#
# Run before every new migration. Then:
#   supabase/migrations/<NEXT>_<short_description>.sql       (UP)
#   supabase/migrations/<NEXT>_<short_description>.down.sql  (DOWN — paired)
